# History

## 2026-05-07

- Created after production showed transient SQLite `database is locked` errors across token billing,
  MCP session locks, scheduled job starts, and LinuxDo OAuth upserts.
- Chose bounded retry hardening as the first repair because the evidence showed short writer
  collisions, while API rebalance selection and research result key pinning were behaving as
  designed.

## 2026-05-24

- Extended the same lock-hardening line to forward-proxy startup: subscription refresh now fetches
  multiple feeds concurrently, runtime snapshot persistence retries transient busy/locked writes,
  and startup logs now break out sqlite, refresh, xray, and store-sync phases.

## 2026-05-31

- Removed a repeated startup backfill from the LinuxDo system tag path after production startup
  timing showed SQLite initialization dominated by no-op per-user binding sync on an already
  consistent database.
